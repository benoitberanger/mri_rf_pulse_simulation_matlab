# Summary
In **M**agnetic **R**esonance **I**maging ($MRI$), you need to excite matter using **R**adio**F**requency ($RF$) pulses. However, there is a lot of them. Some pules are designed to selectivly excite a specific volume, like slice of matter, while other are "non-selective". Why are they so different from each other ? How to compare them ? Which one to choose ? The first objective of the toolbox is, within a GUI, to select a pulse in the library, simulate it's response, and display the results:
